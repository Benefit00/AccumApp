Accumulo App

A basic android app with company details and a bond calculator

This project is my first android app that I am creating to learn java for making android mobile apps.

Things I need to do 1)Create and populate a "Contact Us" screen. The screen should have the company contact details and be able to call the releaant phone functions from within the app. That is if a user clicks the phone number it must launch the devices phone app and populate the screen with the compaany number Similarly for the address, it should open the devices navigation app and prompt for a location origin and direct to the company

2)Create and populate an "About Us" screen This screen should contain 3 profile pictures, one for each of the directors with a small write up about each of them.

3)Design the app so that it can display push notifications to the user.

4)Build a bond / mortgage calculator that can give a user an estimate of the loan amount that will be potentially available to them.

5)Have fun learning :D
